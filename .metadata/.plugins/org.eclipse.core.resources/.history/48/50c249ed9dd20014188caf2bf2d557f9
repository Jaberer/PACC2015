\section{Methods}

For this project, we mainly used Python to read data from csv and crunch
numbers, specifically using the \textit{numpy} and \textit{scipy} packages to
perform statistical analysis. For data visualization, we used
\textit{matplotlib} package for Python to create histograms and scatter plots.



\section{General Data Analysis}



\subsection{Which soccer player had the most sleep per night throughout the
season?}

The player with the greatest total number of hours is player 7, with an average
of 9.12 hours per night.

\subsection{Is there a significant difference in the average amount of sleep
for athletes weekends vs. weekdays?}

A two sample t-test is somewhat applicable here.

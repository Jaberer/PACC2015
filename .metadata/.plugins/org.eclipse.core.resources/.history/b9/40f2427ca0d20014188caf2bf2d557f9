\section{Methods}

For this project, we mainly used Python to read data from csv and crunch
numbers, specifically using the \textit{numpy} and \textit{scipy} packages to
perform statistical analysis. For data visualization, we used
\textit{matplotlib} package for Python to create histograms and scatter plots.



\section{General Data Analysis}



\subsection{Which soccer player had the most sleep per night throughout the
season?}

We added up the hours of sleep for each player, and divided it by the number of
sleep entries to get the average hours of sleep per night. The player with the
greatest total number of hours is player 7, with an average of 9.123 hours per night.

\subsection{Is there a significant difference in the average amount of sleep
for athletes weekends vs. weekdays?}

We get a mean of 
A two sample t-test is somewhat applicable here. We get $t\approx 1.533$ and
$p\approx 0.125$. Thus there is a decent probability that there a significant
difference between the average sleep hours of the two

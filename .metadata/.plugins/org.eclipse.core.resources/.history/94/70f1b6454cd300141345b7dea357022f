\section{Methods}

For this project, we mainly used Python to read data from csv and crunch
numbers, specifically using the \textit{numpy} and \textit{scipy} packages to
perform statistical analysis. For data visualization, we used
\textit{matplotlib} package for Python to create histograms and scatter plots.



\section{General Data Analysis}



\subsection{Which soccer player had the most sleep per night throughout the
season?}

We added up the hours of sleep for each player, and divided it by the number of
sleep entries to get the average hours of sleep per night. The player with the
greatest total number of hours is player 7, with an average of 9.123 hours per night.

\subsection{Is there a significant difference in the average amount of sleep
for athletes weekends vs. weekdays?}

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{weekdayDist}
\end{figure}

We get a mean of 8.153 hours for weekdays, and a mean of 8.089 hours for
weekends. A two sample t-test is somewhat applicable here. We get $t\approx
1.533$ and $p\approx 0.125$. Thus there is a decent probability that there a significant
difference between the average sleep hours of athletes on weekdays and weekends.

\subsection{Create a histogram of the hours of sleep players on the volleyball team got throughout
the season. What is the range of the number of hours of sleep? Which player(s) slept
the most/least in a night? Make one observation of your own about the data in this
chart.}

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Distributions of hours of sleep a night for volleyball players}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{volleyballSleep}
\end{figure}

We found that the the range of hours sleep per night was 13 hours, going from a
minimum of 2 hours, to a maximum of 15 hours. Player 22 slept the least number
of hours per night on one occasion of 2 hours, and player 22 slept the most
number of hours per night one time for 15 hours. Looking at the graph, we also
notice that the distribution is relatively normal.

\subsection{Plot stress vs. mood for volleyball players (scatter plot). Do you think this plot is useful
for showing how (or if) mood and stress are related? Why or why not? Suggest an
alternate plot or a few changes that would improve this visualization. You may actually
generate this plot or simply describe and sketch it.}

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Scattergram of stress vs. mood for volleyball players.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{volleyBallMoodVStressScatter}
\end{figure}

This plot doesn't really show the distribution of the stress and mood pairs, so
it doesn't help us analyze the data. It only shows where a stress and mood pair
exists.

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Scattergram redone. The area of a point is proportional to the
frequency of data at that point.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{volleyBallMoodVStressScatter2}
\end{figure}

This scattergram does a better job of showing the relationship between stress
and mood pairs, since it shows better the most frequent stress level at a given
mood.

\section{Game Day Preparation}

\subsection{Do athletes sleep more the night before a game?}

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Distribution of hours of sleep for before a gameday, and before non-gamedays.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{5}
\end{figure}

We created a list of hours of sleep of both volleyball and soccer players before
their respective gamedays, and another list for hours of sleep before their
non-gamedays. The mean hours of sleep before a gameday for an athlete is about
8.255, while on non-gamedays, the average is about 8.110 hours. A t-test on
these two samples gives $t\approx 3.077$ and $p\approx 0.002$ which indicates
that there very likely is a significant difference between hours of sleep before 
a gameday and hours of sleep prior to a non-gameday.

\section{Game Day Impacts}

\subsection{Do athletes feel more stress on game days or on days without games?}

\begin{figure}[H]
\caption{Distributions of levels of stress on a gameday, and on a
non-gameday.}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{6}
\end{figure}

Due to the stress levels being qualitative properties, it makes more sense for
the average to be the mode here. Average for the gameday is 3, while
for non-gameday is 4. To decide whether the underlying distributions of the two
samples are identical or not, we can use a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
This gives us $D=0.096$ and $p < 0.001$ which strongly suggests that there is a
significant difference between the stress distribution of the two populations.
